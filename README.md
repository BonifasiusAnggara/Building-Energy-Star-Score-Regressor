# Building-Energy-Star-Score-Regressor

machine-learning-project-walkthrough

An implementation of a complete machine learning solution in Python on a real-world dataset. This project is meant to demonstrate how all the steps of a machine learning pipeline come together to solve a problem!

In this project, we will work with publicly available building energy data from New York City. The objective is to use the energy data to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the results to find the factors which influence the score.

We are using the general outline of the Machine Learning Pipeline to structure our project:

1. Data cleaning and formatting
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering and Selection
4. Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model to optimize it for the problem
6. Evaluate the best model on the testing set
7. Interpret the model results to the extent possible
8. Draw conclusions and write a well documented report

The first notebook covered steps 1-3, and the second notebook will cover 4-6, and the third notebook will cover steps 7-8.

Enjoy!!
